vi PREFA CE.

text: Gothic 2 col. 38 lines, red and black. Printed sursace:
1 15 >< 77 mm.

No signature-titles.

Regz'strum follows regulae generales, and on the same page
as registrum is a table of errata to which reference will osten
be made in the notes. In many parts of the text the red has
also been obliterated by black lettering. This edition is full
. of misprints.

In this copy sheet C is wanting; it contained the psalter
from the none of Monday to the none of Tuesday.

2. V. (The Editor’s copy.) The present book is a
reprint of this edition.

16⁰. ff. 640. Psalter 1—-75 recto· Dominicale 76 recto-
5 70 recto, Sanctorale 571 recto—640 verso.

Roman, red and black, 32 lines. Preface single column.
Text double columns. Printed surface: 64 >< 104 mm.

Signature title: B. N. except on sheets A and B, when it
is Β. R. In this copy sheet Ι is wanting; from Matins of
Saturday to None of Saturday. From the end of ps, 54 on
p. 15 to the beginning of ps. 127 on p. 18 the reprint has
followed R. as its text.

3. A fragment of an edition is preserved in the National
Library at Paris, as Pz'e‘ce unique. (17667.)

It consists of 8 leaves: Roman type, number of lines
31 or 32. The printed surface is 128><78 or 125><77
mm.

At the top of the first page there is: Breviarium Roma-
num ex sacra Ι potissimum scriptura et proba Ι tis. Sanctorum
Historiis con Ι stans M.D.XXXV.1 (in black capitals)‚ fol-
lowed immediately underneath by: >κ Ad Sanfflss. Patrem
et DN. Paulum ΙΙΙ., and the rest follows as in other
editions. It contains the vt in the first page left out by
P. and also in Thielman Kerver’s edition.

The piece ends with the brief of Paul III. to Antonio
Blado.

At first sight it looks like a fragment of R. but R. does
not repeat the title before the address of the preface: nor is
the sign >Ι< before the address. Nor does the pagination or
lineation correspond.
